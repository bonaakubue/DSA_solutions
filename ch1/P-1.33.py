#Write a Python program that simulates a handheld calculator. Your pro- gram should 
# process input from the Python console representing buttons that are “pushed,” and then 
# output the contents of the screen after each op- eration is performed. Minimally, your 
# calculator should be able to process the basic arithmetic operations 
# and a reset/clear operation.
